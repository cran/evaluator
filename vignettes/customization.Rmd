Evaluator makes several assumptions to get you up and running as quickly as 
possible. Advanced users may implement several different customizations 
including:

## Parameters

- Risk tolerances - Organizational risk tolerances at a "medium" and "high" 
level are defined in `inputs/risk_tolerances.csv`. Risk tolerances are the
aggregate economic loss thresholds defined by your organization. These are not 
necessarily the same as the size of potential losses from individual 
scenarios. A good proxy for risk tolerance is the budget authority implemented 
in your organization. The size of purchase signoff required at the executive 
level is generally a good indicator of the minimum floor for high risk 
tolerance.
- Qualitative mappings - The translation of qualitative labels such as 
"Frequent" threat events and "Optimized" controls are defined in 
`inputs/qualitative_mappings.csv`. The values in this mapping may be changed 
but they must use lowercase and agree with the values used in the survey 
spreadsheet. Changing the number of levels used for any qualitative label 
(e.g. changing High/Medium/Low to High/Medium/Low/VeryLow) is possible as long 
as the survey spreadsheet uses the same labels. 
  - The survey spreadsheet uses data validation to populate drop downs. If you 
  change the mappings, the validation will need to be updated or removed to 
  agree with your new mappings.

## Report Customization

If you would rather work on the source RMarkdown file or direct editing and 
graphics tweaking, use `system.file("rmd, "analyze_risk.Rmd", package = "evaluator")` 
to find the location of the native template on your system.

- Styling - Look and feel (fonts, colors, etc.) is defined in the 
`styles/html-styles.css` and `styles/word-styles-reference.docx` files.
